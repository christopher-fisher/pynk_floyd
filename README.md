Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) built with Python, the TensorFlow library and the Keras API to generate novel Pink Floyd-esque song lyrics.
This project was based on the TensorFlow "Text generation with an RNN" tutorial found here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation
It was then modified for ease of use and to better work with the training data I was using.

The details of this project and its results will be written up and posted online shortly, hopefully within the next few days.
